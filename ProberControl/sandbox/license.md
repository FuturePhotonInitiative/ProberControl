##Outstanding Questions
* Why do we want to give the software entirely, meaning why give users all source files? As an alternative we could give them only source code for files we intend for them to change. Then for files like ProberControl.py and Maitre.py we can give them only compiled code-- pyc files.

##My Personal Favorite:
