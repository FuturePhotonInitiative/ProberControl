<br>

The goal of the prober control software is to deliver a framework that can be used to execute automated tests on different hardware setups. The prober control features a clear structure on how to bind-in and access new tools and methodologies.

The prober controller will provide a clear mechanism for integrating switches (independent of the nature of the switch) in a test setups and how to assign signals lucid to the IOs where they are needed. The prober controller will provide a transparent system on reflecting the connected probe inside the code.
